Three teams from UPLB participated in the recently concluded Algolympics 2020 Final Round last February 22, 2020. The final round is an *ACM ICPC-like* contest wherein teams are given a set of programming problems to be solved in a given amount of time. Out of 19 participating teams from nine local universities, our three Team Eliens ranked **4th**, **8th**, and **17th** place. The three teams are as follows.

A package from `GitHub Education`_ arrived containing several GitHub_ items such as free printed copies of Git cheat sheets, Github-flavored markdown guides, and Github for Robotics comic; Github Education posters; and Octocat_ stickers. Sir Clinton requested these *swags* for free as a verified teacher member of GitHub Education.
